Onboarding Webpack Example
==========================

A simple implementation of `polymer-webpack-loader` that will show how it can be used to build a simple web app for the onboarding project.

Currently works for Chrome and Safari. Needs support for Web Components polyfill. 

Installation
------------
Install Yarn dependencies:
```
yarn
```
Then install Bower dependencies:
```
bower install
```
Then build and run a server:
```
yarn run start
```

That will bundle the JS and run the dev server. Then just go to `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.
